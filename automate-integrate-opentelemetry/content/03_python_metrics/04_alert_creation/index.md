## Creating alerts in Dynatrace

alerting (auto-adaptive / seasonal baseline)

Observe: measurements on demand

Understand: dynatrace dimensions & metrics

### Davis Exploritory Anlysis

Quickly identify observability signals relevant to any signal behavior (for example, a spike on a chart) that you want to investigate. Now that our metrics are connected to the topology they can be included in this anlysis. 

Highlight an area in the unified anlysis screen until Anlyze is a teal color. Click Anlyze to trigger the anlysis:

Some things to note:
- Every data analysis relies on the quality of your data. The quality of the results significantly improves when you select a phenomenon correctly.
- Causal correlation analysis requires that portions of normal behavior in a reference time series be selectedâ€“both before and after any phenomenon under analysis. For a spike analysis, a rule of thumb is that the spike itself should cover a third of the reference time series, with one third before and one third after the spike.

### Metric Events (Alerting)
Lets create an Auto Adaptive baseline metric event for the `perform.opentelemetry.hot.process_duration` metric. 

Select the metric from the drop down and click the elipse `...` next to the metric and select `Create metric event`:

By navigating from the Service screen we can see Dynatrace has pre-populated the `Metric selector` for us determining what metric the event will be based off of. 

Expanding the `Advanced query definition` we can set an offset if our metrics have latency. 

We'll set our `Model type` to `Auto-adaptive threshold` and set `Number of signal fluctions`  to 1. Below in the `Alert preview` select `Service=pysrvc svc on port 8090` to get the alert preview:

Hover over the chart to see the upper limit:

Now change the `Number of signal fluctions` to 10 to see how this changes the upper limit - and therefore the senesitivity - of our alert:

Alerting sensitiviy is also based off a sliding window - by default, any three one-minute samples out of five must violate your threshold to raise an event; and five one-minute samples must be back to normal to close this event. You can set a sliding window of up to 60 minutes.

You can adjust these settings under the `Advanced model properties` section of the metric event configuration:

Complete the metric event setup by giving it a Title and optionally set the Event type to be indicitive of the alert being raised:

You can also optionally add properites to be attached to the event as well as a dimension key - for the purposes of our alert lets leave these settings blank and save our new metric event by clicking `Save Changes`.

### Hands on

Now that we've created an Auto-adaptive baseline you'll create a Seasonal Baseline on `perform.opentelemetry.hot.requests_count`.
