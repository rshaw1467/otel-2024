## Connecting log data to traces

In this section, we will explore how Dynatrace allows you view your observability data like traces and logs in context. You can enrich your Dynatrace ingested log data by defining a log pattern to include the ***dt.span_id***, ***dt.trace_id***, ***dt.trace_sampled***, and ***dt.entity.process_group_instance fields***.

In cases where the OneAgent's automatic instrumentation handles the distributed traces, Dynatrace can also automatically enrich the associated logs generated from the application.

In our case, the WebSocket application is not automatically instrumented by the OneAgent and by manually adding OpenTelemetry instrumentation, we will also need to handle the code to  write these span IDs and trace IDs to the logs.

Be sure to follow the rules for the format of the enriched fields in an unstructured log. All these can be found in the reference documentation:

### Before we start
The shopizer application has been pre-configured to use [SLF4 logging framework](https://www.slf4j.org).

If you are interested in how the Java application is configured for the SLF4 logging framework, you can refer to <mark>**application.properties**</mark> file in <mark>**sm-shop/src/main/resources**</mark> directory.

In the meantime, we will need to configure the log sources to specifically ingest logs from <mark>**/tmp/spring.log** </mark>.

Here are the steps to configure Dynatrace to ingest logs
1. Navigate to **Settings > Log Monitoring**.
1. Expand it and select  **Log sources and stroage**.
1. Click on the tab labled ***Process groups perspective***.
   - üìù**Note:** Dynatrace offers an updated configuration experience as an ***opt-in*** option. Talk to any instructor if you would like to know more.
   - We will use the existing UI in today's hands on.
1. Select the check box next to <mark>**com.salesmanager.shop.application.ShopApplication** </mark>.
1. **Important:** Remember to click on <mark>**Save changes** </mark>.

This is how the configuration looks like:

Wait for a few minutes after the configuration. To view the ingested logs, navigate to **Dynatrace menu > logs**.

### üìå Task

**Task:** Make changes to <mark>**TaggingStompSession.java** </mark> to include the span ID and trace ID in the logs

Open <mark>**TaggingStompSession.java** </mark> in the directory

```
sm-shop/src/main/java/com/salesmanager/shop/store/controller/product/
```

1. Import the ***SpanContext*** Java libs. This has already been done for you in <mark>line **20** </mark>.
1. Retrieve the span context from the span that was started from the ***span.makeCurrent()*** OpenTelemetry function.
   - Uncomment <mark>line **53** </mark>
1. Retrieve span and trace IDs and insert them to the logs.
   - Uncomment <mark>line **55** </mark>
   - ***spanContext.getTraceId()*** and ***spanContext.getSpanId()*** are respectively used to retrieve the traceID and spanID of the current span.
1. Restart the application to verify any changes:

```bash
Ctrl + C
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Results

1. Navigate to **Dynatrace menu > logs** again.
1. In the ***Filter by*** bar, type in <mark>**chat** </mark>.
1. The logs will be filtered down to contents matching the keyword ***chat***. CLick on any one of the log entries.

1. Expore the meta-data.
1. Click on <mark>**View trace** </mark> button to jump into the distributed traces view.
1. Navigate to the ***SEND /app/chat/java*** span and click on it.
1. Click on the ***Logs*** tab to reveal the specific log entry that matches that span entry.

### Summary

Connecting OpenTelemetry traces to logs allows you to analze the observability data in context. This can be done easily in Dynatrace. This allows for more effective diagnostics capabilities. In addition, DAVIS AI engine will be able to make use of the contextual data when generating problem cards.

  ### The full java code should look like this
  ```java
  try (Scope scope = span.makeCurrent()) {
	  SpanContext spanContext = Span.current().getSpanContext();
	  GlobalOpenTelemetry.getPropagators().getTextMapPropagator().inject(Context.current(), headers, this);
	  LOG.info("[!dt dt.trace_id=" + spanContext.getTraceId() + ",dt.span_id=" + spanContext.getSpanId() + "] sending message to " + headers.getDestination());
	  return session.send(headers, payload);
  } finally {
	  span.end();
  }
  ```
